## Section One
### 1.1 Tactical Combat Casualty Care Overview
The Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) concept was developed in 1996 by special operations forces. Tactical Combat Casualty Care guidelines are evidence-based and battlefield-proven to reduce deaths at the point of injury (POI). Department of Defense (DOD) and NATO allies require TCCC training for deploying forces because it combines effective tactics and medicine. TCCC-Medical Provider (TCCC-MP) is training for medical personnel. TCCC-All Combatants (TCCC-AC) is training for first responders and nonmedical personnel. TCCC training is performed in three phases: Care under fire (CUF), tactical field care (TFC), and tactical evacuation care (TEC). TCCC teaches first responders to treat casualties in the proper order, treating the most critical situations first. This is done using the acronyms MARCH and PAWS (see below).

### 1.2 Care Under Fire
CUF is conducted while tactically engaged. The most effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality is the precise application of combat fires by all personnel. Continue the tactical mission, gain fire superiority, then treat casualties. The control of extremity hemorrhage with direct pressure while applying a hasty tourniquet is the primary medical goal during CUF. A tourniquet is the single most important medical intervention rendered at the point of injury (POI).

### 1.2.1 Hasty Tourniquet

Step One
{: .label .label-green }
During the care under fire phase, place the tourniquet as high on the extremity as possible and over the uniform. This is a hasty tourniquet. (This will be transitioned to a deliberate tourniquet on the skin, 2 inches above the injury in the tactical field care phase.)

Step Two
{: .label .label-green }
Route the self-adhering band through the friction adapter buckle. Pull the band tight, removing all slack.

Step Three
{: .label .label-green }
Feed the self-adhering band tight around the extremity and securely fasten it back on itself. No more than three fingers should fit between the band and the injured extremity.

Step Four
{: .label .label-green }
Twist the windlass rod until the bleeding stops and the distal pulse has been eliminated.

Step Five
{: .label .label-green }
Lock the windlass rod in place with the windlass clip.

Step Six
{: .label .label-green }
Grasp the windlass strap, pull tight, and adhere it to the windlass clip.

Step Seven
{: .label .label-green }
If the tactical situation permits, check for a distal pulse. If a distal pulse is still present, apply a second tourniquet side by side and proximal to the first. Tighten this tourniquet and recheck the distal pulse.

### 1.3 Tactical Field Care
When no longer receiving effective enemy fire, the TFC phase is entered, allowing more medical intervention. Disarm the casualty, if the casualty’s mental status is altered or if receiving ketamine or fentanyl. Medical personnel are responsible for activity inside the casualty collection point (CCP) and leadership is responsible for activity outside the CCP. Basic life support (cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]) is typically not performed in combat.

### 1.3.1 Triage Card
**Triage**
Triage will be performed at all levels. Traditional categories of triage are immediate, delayed, minimal, and expectant. To easily remember the order of the categories, use the acronym IDME. No significant treatment should occur in the triage area. Casualties should be rapidly sent to the appropriate treatment area for care.

**Immediate**
This group requires attention within minutes to 2 hours upon arrival to avoid death or major disability. Injuries include airway obstruction or potential compromise, tension pneumothorax, uncontrolled hemorrhage, threatened loss of limb, or multiple extremity amputations.

**Delayed**
This group includes those wounded who are in need of surgery, but whose general condition permits delay in treatment without unduly endangering life, limb, or eyesight. Injuries include blunt or penetrating torso injuries, fractures, soft-tissue injuries, facial fractures without airway compromise, globe injuries, or survivable burns.

**Minimal**
This group has relatively minor injuries (e.g., minor lacerations, abrasions, fractures of small bones, and minor burns) and can effectively care for themselves with minimal medical care. These casualties may also provide manpower to assist with movement or care of the injured. Such casualties may inundate the facility, leading to early commitment and ineffective utilization of resources. It is imperative to secure and strictly control access to the military treatment facility (MTF) immediately upon notification of a mass casualty event.

### 1.3.2 PMARCH and PAWS
**MARCH Acronym**
MARCH (massive hemorrhage, airway, respirations, circulation, head injury/hypothermia) is an acronym used by TCCC-trained individuals to help remember the proper order of treatment. 

**Massive Hemorrhage**
The number one potentially survivable cause of death at the POI is hemorrhage from a compressible wound or any life-threatening extremity bleed. More than 90 percent of 4,596 combat deaths post 11 September 2001 died of hemorrhage-associated injuries. The hasty application of a Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (CoTCCC)-approved tourniquet is the recommended management for all life-threatening extremity hemorrhages during care under fire (see page 4). It is initially placed over clothing, high and tight. The deliberate application of a tourniquet is addressed when behind cover and during tactical field care to ensure proper hemorrhage control. The tourniquet is placed under clothing 2 to 3 inches above the wound. The application time is written on the tourniquet. Combat gauze is the hemostatic dressing of choice.

**Airway**
A second survivable cause of death at the POI is a non-patent (closed) airway. Airway injuries typically occur from maxillofacial trauma or inhalation burns. A conscious and speaking casualty has a patent open airway. An unconscious casualty who is breathing can benefit from the nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) (see page 8). An unconscious casualty who is not breathing may require a definitive airway such as a surgical cricothyroidotomy (see page 11). In a combat setting, endotracheal intubation is highly difficult, if not impossible.

**Respirations**
The third potentially survivable cause of death on the battlefield is the development of a tension pneumothorax (PTX). Air trapped in the chest cavity begins to displace functional lung tissue and places pressure on the heart, resulting in cardiac arrest. Seal open chest wounds with a vented chest seal, decompress a suspected PTX, and support ventilation/oxygenation, as required. Treat a PTX via needle chest decompression (NCD) using a 14-gauge, 3.25-inch-long needle with a catheter.

**Circulation**
Control of bleeding takes precedence over infusing fluids. Only individuals in shock or those who need intravenous (IV) medications need to have IV access established. Use an 18-gauge catheter and saline lock in a field setting. Give tranexamic acid (TXA) as soon as feasible to casualties in or at risk of hemorrhagic shock. Once a saline lock is established, secure it with transparent wound-dressing film. Administer fluids by a second needle and a catheter through the film dressing. When the infusion is complete, withdraw the needle, leaving the saline lock in place. An intraosseous (IO) device is an alternative route for administering fluids when fluid resuscitation is required and an IV access cannot be obtained. Clinical signs of shock on the battlefield are: 1) unconsciousness or altered mental status not due to coexisting traumatic brain injury (TBI) or drug therapy; and/or 2) abnormal radial pulse.

**PAWS Acronym**
PAWS (pain, antibiotics, wounds, splinting) is an acronym used by TCCC trained individuals to help remember additional casualty care issues. As noted in the U.S. Central Command Joint Theater Trauma System publication, Saving Lives on the Battlefield, Part I, 30 January 2013, and Saving Lives on the Battlefield, Part II, 30 May 2014, a survey of military personnel deployed showed that pain management, antibiotics, splinting, and reassessing interventions and additional wounds were often not performed. The PAWS acronym allows personnel to recall these interventions while under duress.

**Paint**
Management of a casualty’s pain helps reduce stress on the mind and body. By managing pain from the POI onward, casualties have reduced incidents of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at Role 4 care (rehabilitation) and beyond. Pain management reduces patient movement, improves compliance and cooperation, and allows for better casualty transport and outcomes.

**Wounds**
Assessing and treating casualties with additional wounds improves morbidity and mortality. Minor scalp lacerations can be the cause of excessive hemorrhage. First responders must address burns, open fractures, facial trauma, amputation dressings, and security of tourniquets. Reassessment of wounds and interventions prior to movement is critical. When preparing the patient for transport, casualties with penetrating trauma to the chest or abdomen should be evacuated on an emergent basis, due to the possibility of internal hemorrhage. Responders should give TXA as soon as feasible to casualties in or at risk of hemorrhagic shock.

**Splinting**
Medical personnel should address pelvic disruptions and eye injuries. The energy required to cause a lower extremity traumatic amputation (from an improvised explosive device, land mine, etc.) moves upward through the body, potentially causing further bone disruption, hollow organ collapse, or internal bleeding. Responders should use the Combat Ready Clamp (CRoC), the Junctional Emergency Treatment Tool (JETT), or the SAM Junctional Tourniquet to control junctional hemorrhage and stabilize the pelvis. Splinting of fractures can result in significant pain relief and minimize bleeding.
