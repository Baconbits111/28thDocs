## Safety

### Safety Of Airframe
As an aviator in the 28th ECAB, the largest and most important part of conducting rotary operation is the safety of each and every airframe. From following proper SOPs for hanging and storing aircraft, to conducting airborne operations, the safety of the airframe is of the utmost importance.

### Safety Of Crew
In close relation to the safety of the airframe, the safety of the crew is just as important. As an aviator, whenever you get into, or around the aircraft, you are responsible for the lives and wellbeing of everyone around that airframe. During times where stress is high, make sure to keep the lives of everyone onboard in mind.

## Training
Training is an important step to improving and mastering the skills necessary to become a Senior Pilot. All aviators upon entering into the 28th ECAB will be required to train in their preferred airframe and pass checkrides to be deemed as proficient aviators in their respective designations. Each new pilot looking to become future SPs need to focus on training to hone in their skills, and progress through the ranks.
