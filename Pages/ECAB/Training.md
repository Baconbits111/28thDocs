## Training Pipeline

### WOCS
Warrant Officer Candidate School (WOCS) is a class conducted by a qualified member of 28th ECABs COC to assess and instruct all would-be pilots. WOCS will cover items such as Navigation, Equipment Usage, Leadership Abilities, Safe Workplace Practices and Warrant Officer Duties. Bear in mind, WOCS, while branded a school, is more of an assessment of the capability for a future aviator to handle stress, rapid information and quick assessment of hazards/obstacles.

### Flight School
Flight School, while similar in nature to WOCS, is more focused on aviation knowledge and rotary/fixed wing operations. Flight School can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours based on proficiency and airframe knowledge. While WOCS is intended to breed out the weak, Flight School offers a more individual and hands on learning experience, allowing all that pass WOCS to become highly proficient aviators.

### Check Rides
Check Rides are an important step in determining the capabilities of an aviator. There are a total of 6 checkrides in use by the 28th ECAB.
- WOCS Basic Proficiency Check Ride
- Flight School Graduation Checkride
- PC Checkride
- MTP Checkride
- SP Checkride
- Gunnery Checkride
To progress through the ranks and earn proficiency within airframes, pilots must show competency and perform various tasks within their airframe, and exhibit basic proficiency to the pilot in command of the checkride. **Please Remember That The PC of The Flight Has The Ability To Bar You From The Rest Of The Checkride At Any Point.**
