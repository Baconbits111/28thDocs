### CH-47F Chinhook
The largest aircraft that the 28th operates is the CH-47 Chinook. The chinook is a large, heavy, cargo transport helicopter that fits and dominates its role. The CH-47’s main purpose is the transport of troops to and from the battlefield, along with their cargo, but the airframe can also take on the role of sling loading, area suppression, and airborne operations.

### AH-64D Apache
The AH-64 Longbow/Apache is the most feared and respected airframe that the 28th has to offer. The AH-64, a large attack helicopter, is designed for one purpose, to eliminate and destroy the enemy. Whether the Apache is performing ISR or eliminating enemy vehicles, it dominates its competition.
