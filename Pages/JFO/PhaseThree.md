## Phase Three "Out"
Phase 3 "Out" is the final phase of training for a JFO. At this point they should be able to effectively and timely call a variety of supporting assets in, in order to successfully complete the mission. Phase 3 will consist of a last chance to ask any questions, followed by a final test. The final test can be substituted for an official op if the trainee feels confident.

### The Final Test Will Consist Of:
- Being Dropped at a Known Point Without A GPS
- Movement to an OP
- Establishing an OP
- Observing and Reporting Enemy Locations
- Using Both Artillery and CAS to Destroy Enemy Positions
- Movement from the OP to a HLZ Established by the Trainee
- Calling for Exfil using a HLZ Brief- The Trainee will then be Transported to a Simulated Mass Casualty Incident and will need to Identify Casualties and call for a Medivac

### Once The Final Test Is Completed The Trainee Will Be A Certified JFO
