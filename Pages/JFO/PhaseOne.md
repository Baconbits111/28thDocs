## Phase One "Radio"
Phase 1 "Radio" is a representation of basic RTO qualifications. Land navigation without a GPS, use of 8 digit grids, basic radio communications, use of the SATCOM antenna, and enemy vehicle identification will be covered in this phase. RTOs and incoming Pilots must pass Phase 1.

### Land Navigation:
Land Navigation will begin with a basic introduction to the use of your map to refresh from basic training. Use of 8 digits grids will also be taught/reviewed.

Trainees will then conduct train association and learn how to navigate using only a map and compass.

Following this a land navigation test will be conducted with trainees navigating to 3 points chosen by the instructor.

### Use of a SATCOM Antenna:
SATCOM antennas increase the range of your radio 4x and negate terrain. Instructors will show how to employ the SATCOM antenna.

### Enemy Vehicle Identification:
Using the display of Russian and Soviet era equipment present on airbase Carter instructors will familiarize trainees with potential enemy vehicles and their capabilities.

### Establishing a Helicopter Landing Zone:
Trainees will be instructed how to identify Helicopter landing zones and how to transmit a HLZ Brief. Trainees will then prepare a minimum of 2 simulated HLZs.

### 9 Line Medivac:
Instructors will teach trainees how to call for medivacs. This includes "5 to fly" and procedures for loading casualties.
