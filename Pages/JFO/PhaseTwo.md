Trainees will be instructed on how to identify targets and create a 9 line CAS request in order to effectively engage hostile forces. Standard methods of marking will be covered.. Trainees will be familiarized with different weapon systems commonly found on aircraft and the proper employment of said systems. In addition trainees will be familiarized with the CAS Check in brief. A simulated test will then be conducted. A practical test will be conducted if aircraft are available for training.
