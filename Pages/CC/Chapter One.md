## Combination Of Arms
The Army’s preferred method of fighting is combined arms. Combined arms warfare is based on concepts of strengths and weaknesses. All weapons, branches, and tactics have their strengths, weaknesses, advantages and disadvantages. Understanding this, leaders use the power of combination to protect their weaknesses and using their strengths to create dilemmas for the enemy. Leaders create complimentary effects when they arrange elements with different characteristics together. Complimentary effects allow leaders to protect friendly vulnerabilities and or enhanced effects on enemies. For example leaders can combine the effects from their direct fire weapons and mortars to produce an overall greater effect on the enemy force.

Taking a single tracked approach can lead to poor or unsuccessful results. Focusing on one single tactical function does not present the enemy with a dilemma. Without a complimentary effect, the enemy is exposed to a problem that can be solved with a likely solution. The enemy only needs to escape the problem at hand. Without a 2nd or 3rd stressor to impair their ability to make sound decisions and the enemy is able to react and stay in the fight.

## Combat Power
Combat power is the ability of a unit to fight. To generate combat power units conduct operations. Leaders at all levels use tools to develop and conduct operations. The most important tool is the 4 crucial functions. Those functions are Find, Fix, Flank, Follow Through. First a unit must find and make contact with an enemy unit. Next they fix the enemy with direct and or indirect fire. Third, the unit must finish the enemy by fire and maneuver towards a vulnerable point. Lastly the unit must follow through with consolidation, reorganization and preparing to continue the mission.

## Infantry Weapons
There are 5 types of weapons used at the infantry platoon level. Small arms, machine guns, grenade launchers, shoulder launched munitions, and close combat missile systems.
