### Step Two
Once the squad leader has set up his/her support by fire(SBF) team, he will then get his other team to start flanking. At this point the SBF team can open fire if the squad leader tells them to.

### Step Three
In this example the squad leader has told the trail teamto flank right. Bravo team would be moving on their own path unless the squad leader told them to take a specific route. **Note: When moving, bravo team should be taking the most covered and concealed areas possible.**

### Step Four
Once the trail team has gotten on the enemies flank they will get on line and start pushing on the enemy group while shooting. **Note: They should be using individual movement techniques while moving.**

### Step Five
Once bravo team starts moving in, the suppression team will the shift or lift fire. **Note: There should be a 10-20 degree buffer between the flanking element and the weapons of the SBF team. 10-20 degrees is as big as the fist held horizontally next to the weapon.**

### Step Six

### Step Seven
Once bravo calls alpha and tells them they are set, alpha team and the squad leader will pick up and move through the enemy positions sweeping whatever remains, moving to their LOA.

### Step Eight
When both teams have reached their LOA, the squad leader will do an ace report and call for anything that is needed. **Note: Once all teams ahve reached their LOA, you have 5 minutes to do everything you need to do before leaving the area.**
