## Tactical Casualty Combat Care(TC3/TCCC)
- Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC or TC3) is the standard of care in prehospital battlefield medicine. The three objectives of TC3 are to provide lifesaving care to the injured combatant, to limit the risk of further casualties, and to help the unit achieve mission success. The 3 phases of TC3 are Care Under FIre(CUF), Tactical Field Care(TFC), and Tactical Evacuation Care(TACEVAC).
- CUF is characterized as the care rendered to a casualty while still under effective fire. In this case, the first action is to return fire and take cover as fire superiority over the enemy is the best medicine to include the casualty remaining engaged if able. As an enemy is suppressed, casualties can move or be moved to more secure positions. The only medical treatment rendered in CUF is stopping life-threatening hemorrhage (bleeding). TC3 actively endorses and recommends the early and immediate use of tourniquets to control massive external hemorrhage of limbs. All other treatment should be delayed until the casualty can be moved to a more secure and covered position and transitioned to tactical field care.
- TFC is care rendered by first responders or prehospital medical personnel(medics and CLS) while still in the tactical environment. The first thing you should be worried about is hemorrhage. The next would be to worry about heart rate and blood pressure. Finally you would worry about pain management, although this should not be worried about if there are other casualties.
- In TACEVAC you still worry about the same things that are in TFC but your main goal is to evacuate the casualty. You can either use a traditional medical vehicle(MEDEVAC) or a non traditional medical vehicle(CASEVAC)
