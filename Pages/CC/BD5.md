### Step Two
Once fire superiority has been established, the squad leader will then begin giving movement orders to the trail team. In this example, the squad leader told the trail team to flank right. Bravo team would be moving on their own path unless the squad leader told them to take a specific path. **Note: When moving, bravo team should be taking the most covered and concealed areas possible.**

### Step Three
Once the trail team has gotten on the bunkers flank, they will get on line and start pushing the bunker. **Note: They should be using individual movement techniques while moving.**
