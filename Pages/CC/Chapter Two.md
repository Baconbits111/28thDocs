## Tactical Movements and Techniques
This section discusses movement formations of Infantry fire teams, squads, and platoons. The platoon leader uses formations for several purposes: to relate one squad to another on the ground; to position firepower to support the direct-fire plan; to establish responsibilities for sector security among squads; or to aid in the execution of battle drills. Just as they do with movement techniques, platoon leaders plan formations based on where they expect enemy contact, and on the company commander’s plans to react to contact. The platoon leader evaluates the situation and decides which formation best suits the mission and situation.

### File
The file is used when traveling through dense terrain and when your flanks are exposed. The advantages to this formation are speed, cohesion, and good security to the flanks. Disadvantages are poor security to the front and rear.

### Wedge
The wedge is used when you are in open terrain and enemy contact is likely. Advantages include great security to all flanks, easy to control, and can be adapted to the situation. Disadvantages include impossible to keep formation in dense terrain.

### Echelon
The echelon is used when contact to one side is likely. Similar to the wedge but all fire power is on one side. Advantages are great security to the side echeloned, and can be adapted to the situation. Disadvantages included being harder to control, security to the non echeloned side, front and rear are poor.

### Line
The line is used when you need maximum firepower to the front of your formation.Advantages include max firepower to the front, decent flank security, and decent rear security. Disadvantages include slow, and hard to control.

### Staggered Column
The staggered column is used when patrolling on roads or trails. Advantages and disadvantages are the same as the file. When using this formation on a road you should be 3-5 meters off the road.

### Squad Column, Fireteam Wedge
The squad column is the squads main formation for movement. It provides good dispersion both laterally and in depth without sacrificing control. Perfect formation to be used when using traveling overwatch. Distance from the team leaders to the squad leaders varys on squad leaders discretion.

### Squad File
The squad file has the same characteristics as the fire team file. In the event that the terrain is severely restrictive or extremely close, teams within the squad file may also be in file. This disposition is not optimal for enemy contact, but does provide the squad leader with maximum control. If the squad leader wishes to increase his control over the formation he moves forward to the first or second position. Moving forward also enables him to exert greater morale presence by leading from the front, and to be immediately available to make key decisions.

### Squad Line
The squad line provides maximum firepower to the front and is used to assault or as a pre-assault formation. To execute the squad line, the squad leader designates one of the teams as the base team. The other team cues its movement off of the base team. This applies when the squad is in close combat as well. From this formation, the squad leader can employ any of the three movement techniques or conduct fire and movement.

## Tactical Movements
There are three movement techniques: traveling; traveling overwatch; and bounding overwatch. The selection of a movement technique is based on the likelihood of enemy contact and the need for speed. Factors to consider for each technique are control, dispersion, speed, and security. While traveling in formations, all clock facings will be based off of the direction of travel. Traveling is used when speed is needed and enemy contact is unlikely. When traveling in squad column the distance between fireteams should be 20-30 meters. Traveling overwatch is used when enemy contact is likely. The distance between the last man in the first fireteam to the squad leader should be no less than 50 meters, The purpose behind this is that if the enemy sees the first team they will get engaged and then the other team will have freedom of movement. Bounding overwatch is used when contact is expected, when the squad leader feels the enemy is near (based on movement, noise, reflection, trash, fresh tracks, or even a hunch), or when a large open danger area must be crossed. The lead fire team overwatches first. Soldiers in the overwatch team scan for enemy positions. The squad leader usually stays with the overwatch team. The trail fire team bounds and signals the squad leader when his team completes its bound and is prepared to overwatch the movement of the other team. While performing bounding overwatch there is 2 techniques you can use. Alternate bounding and successive bounding. When using any kind of bounding know that you can bound on a squad level, team level or buddy team level. The image below shows an example of successive bounding. Use successive bounding when enemy fire is heavy or there is a lot of cover to hide behind on the movement path. When bounding in any form you will use the “Im up, he sees me, i'm down” method when moving.

## Danger Areas
When the unit must cross a danger area, it does so as quickly and as carefully as possible. Examples of danger areas include open areas, roads, trails, wire obstacles and minefields. There are 2 types of danger areas. Linear danger areas and open danger areas. If a danger area can be avoided, that route should be taken. When crossing any danger area if your leader wants to keep your order of march, your leader will start from rear to front of the formation. If there is a linear danger area within an open danger area you will NOT conduct a linear danger area crossing because you are already within an open danger area. Linear danger areas are typically the least dangerous of the 2 danger areas. Purely because of the time being exposed in the open. Linear danger areas can be crossed quick making the time exposed minimal. When coming up on a LDA everyone calls out LDA or gives the signal. Then the SL will tell which team to get security. First getting near side then far side. Once security is set the rest of the element will cross and reform marching order and the security team will break off and rejoin the formation.

Open danger areas are the most dangerous crossing and if they can be avoided, AVOID them. ODAs  are typically have minimal cover and concealment in them, making them very dangerous. If an ODA can not be avoided and you come up to one everyone calls out ODA and then the leader will set everyone up on the edge of the ODA and start using bounding overwatch typically by team/squad to cross.If contact is taken while crossing the SL will either have the element in the open try to come back or push to the other side.

There are 2 types of ways to avoid an open danger area. Contour and detour methods. Both accomplish the same thing. It is preference of the leader which one they do. The contour method is when the leader designates a rally point on the far side with the movement azimuth. He then decides which side of the open area to contour around (after considering the distance, terrain, cover and concealment), and moves around the open area. He uses the wood line and vegetation for cover and concealment. When the squad or platoon arrives at the rally point on the far side, the leader reassumes the azimuth to the objective area and continues the mission. The detour method is when the squad or platoon turns 90 degrees to the right or left around the open area and moves in the direction of travel. Once the squad or platoon has passed the danger area, the unit completes the box with another 90-degree turn and arrives at the far-side rally point, then continues the mission. The pace count of the offset and return legs is not added to the distance of the planned route.

## Movement With Vehicles
There are several options available to the platoon leader when augmented with vehicles. The platoon leader should employ the vehicles in conjunction with the rifle squads so each complements the other. Some options include employing them with the infantry rifle squad to support them, employ them separately to provide heavy direct fire or anti tank fires. Infantrymen are better suited for leading combat formations when a route leads through restrictive urban or rural terrain, stealth is desired, enemy anti tank minefields and Enemy anti tank teams are present. Infantry leaders may choose to lead with combat vehicles when there is an armored or tank threat, moving through open terrain with limited cover or concealment, there is a confirmed enemy location/direction, and there are enemy antipersonnel minefields. Most infantry tactics such as bounding, crossing danger areas and movement techniques work will vehicles. With that being said infantry should dismount and clear them if there is a threat to the vehicles or it would be better for infantry to clear.
