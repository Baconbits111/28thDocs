## Battle Drill 1A - Squad Attack
At this point the squad is walking and sees the enemies in front of them.

Once the squad leader has set up his/her support by fire(SBF) team, he will then get his other team to start flanking. At this point the SBF team can open fire if the squad leader tells them to.
--CCT21
In this example the squad leader has told the trail teamto flank right. Bravo team would be moving on their own path unless the squad leader told them to take a specific route. **Note: When moving, bravo team should be taking the most covered and concealed areas possible.**
--CCT22
Once the trail team has gotten on the enemies flank they will get on line and start pushing on the enemy group while shooting. **Note: They should be using individual movement techniques while moving.**
--CCT23
Once bravo team starts moving in, the suppression team will the shift or lift fire. **Note: There should be a 10-20 degree buffer between the flanking element and the weapons of the SBF team. 10-20 degrees is as big as the fist held horizontally next to the weapon.**
--CCT24
Once bravo team moves through the enemy position sweeping and clearing whatever is left, they will move to their LOA(Limit Of Advance), which is 30-50 meters away from enemy positions.
--CCT25
When both teams have reached their LOA, the squad leader will do an ace report and call for anything that is needed. **Note: Once all teams ahve reached their LOA, you have 5 minutes to do everything you need to do before leaving the area.**
