### Step Two
Once the enemies have initiated contact, the Blufor squad will then get on line. **Note: If the squad is in traveling overwatch then the trail team does not have to get on line. They can begin their flank right off the bat.**

### Step Three
Once the squad has formed up on line, the squad leader will then start ordering team leaders what the next tasking is. **Note: Make sure to call out the 3 D's**
