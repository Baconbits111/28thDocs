## Battle Drill 3 - Break Contact

### Step One
This battle drill starts from the point where the squad has already reacted to contact. In this case the enemy force is to strong to attack so the squad leader breaks contact.

### Step Two
The squad leader will bound the teams back at whatever rate is desirable.

### Step Three
Also, the squad leader could instruct the team leaders to bound their teams back on their own. Meaning each fireteam bounds 2 personnel at once.
