## Regulations
### Addressing Supervisors
When addressing anyone in the unit, you should do so with the utmost respect. This is especially true when addressing supervisors. We ask that you always remain professional and respectful. We do not require that you use sir/maâ€™am however this does not excuse you from maintaining proper etiquette.

### Uniforms
There are premade loadouts available for each MOS. These are standard loadouts that have been set by the platoon leader. You are not permitted to make any changes to the functionality of these loadouts.

### Cheating, Hacking And/Or Exploiting
This is fairly obvious and simple to understand. It is **NOT** allowed under any circumstance.

### Streaming And Recording
We encourage members to stream/record our operations, however you must maintain the immersion. This means that you should never be heard talking to your chat while in game.

Streaming/Recording is freely allowed during Main and PVP Operations. You must receive a waiver from a command staff member to allow you to stream/record trainings.
