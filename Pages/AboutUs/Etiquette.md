## Unit Etiquette
### Chat Moderation
In the 28th, we strive to remain as professional as we can. However, we understand there are times that are just meant to be fun. Please be kind, respectful and do not spam chats. We encourage everyone to be active and engage the chats.

### Respect
Respect other players 100% of the time. Never put another member down for any reason. If you are caught breaking this rule, you will be flagged until a command staff has talked to you about the situation.

### Lock It Up
If you ever hear, this is a direct order to shut up, line up, and listen. This will be used for NCOs and officers to get important information across.

### Effort
Just because you got into the community doesnâ€™t mean you should just stop putting in the effort. Continue to help out and be a active participant in the community.

### Community Representation
Remember that even when you are not in our servers you represent the unit. Always uphold a positive standard when in additional private or public servers. Represent our unit well.
