## Unit Eligibility Requirements
### Location and Timezone
The 28th focuses on the United States. The unit announces times in Eastern Standard Time (EST) and Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). **Keep In Mind That Being In A Different Location Or Timezone Has No Effect On Ability To Join The Unit. We Have Multiple Members From Different Countries than The US, But It Is On You To Attend Trainings and/or Operations**

### Username Structure
We have a strict username policy that requires you to follow standard military rank and initials. Please change your in-game name, and your Teamspeak (TS) nickname.
The format for this is (RANK) (First Initial). (Last Name). E.g., if your rank is “PVT”, your first initial is “J”, and your last name is “Smith”, your in-game name has the following form: (PVT J. Smith)
Bear In Mind, When You Join Us Your Rank Will Be E-1/PVT.

### Multi-Clanning
Multi-clanning is permitted as long as your other group(s) do not interfere with our operations and training times.
This means you are allowed to:
- Be in units focusing on other games, e.g., Squad or WoW
- Participate in events hosted by other Arma units

### Expected Attendance
After joining the 28th, you have 14 days to complete one phase of OSUT Training
We announce unit events in advance. Reply to the roll call with your expected attendance. Roll-calls help us to plan events.
If you are inactive for 14 days or more, someone contacts you about your inactivity. 
- Leave of Absence (LOA): announce you are inactive for 2-3 weeks.
- Reserves: announce you you are inactive for a longer period of time
