## In Game Policies
### Entrenching Tool Usage
Usage of the entrenching tool (E-Tool) in the 28th ID is strictly prohibited unless given proper clearance. Clearance can only be given by platoon leadership or the highest level leadership below, if platoon leadership is not available at the time. The purpose behind this regulation is to remove the unrealstic usage of the e-tool. We have identified the over usage in this unit and we don't want to see that happen any longer. Breaking this policy will result in disciplinary action taken against the individual/s and their leadership.

### Personal Ammo and Throwables Capacity
Every member of the 28th ID carrying an M4 or similar weapon should not cary over **10** magazines on their person. Any member carrying a machine gun is limited to the amount they can **personally carry**. This machine gun policy also applies to a dedicated assistant carrying extra ammo for their gunner. In the rifle squad, you may carry up to an extra of **400** rounds of M249 ammo split among the remaining fireteam members that are not in the automatic rifleman billet. Members carrying a grenade launcher may carry up to **15** explosive rounds and **8** smoke rounds. When it comes to throwables, you are only allowed to carry **2** frag grenades and up to **4** smoke grenades of varying colors. The smoke rule only applies to those in non-leadership positions. If in a leadership position, you may carry up to **8** smoke grenades. This also includes JFO/RTO billeted members. You may resupply off of enemy and friendly bodies at any time to bring you back to the maximum limit of all categories if able. Breaking this policy will result in disciplinary action taken against the individual/s and their leadership.

### Morphine and Epinephrine Usage
Morphine and Epinephrine are only to be carried by any members currently filling the roles of Combat Life Saver(CLS) and Medics. Every squad will have 2 CLS personnel per one 9 man squad(1 CLS per fireteam). As the fireteam's CLS, you are restricted to only 2 type of each injector. You are able to give anyone who needs these at any time but it's strongly recommended to use them only in times of dire need. As a squad's CLS soldier, you may resupply your morphine and epinephrine from a medic, only after asking the medic. When resupplying, you may only take enouch to get you back to the limit of 2 injectors. Breaking this policy will result in disciplinary action taken against the individual/s and their leadership.

### Realism Guideline
When in game, you are to maintain a level of realism that is appropriate to the current situation. If you are just "smoking and joking", it's fine to be relaxed. If you find yourself in the field conducting military operations, you are required to mainting discipline. We aknowledge that jokes in the field are going to happen, but remember that there is a time and place for everything. Breaking this policy will result in disciplinary action taken against the individual/s and their leadership.
